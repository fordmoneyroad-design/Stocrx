## 🛠️ If You Need HTML Meta Tag Verification

If you choose the HTML meta tag verification method, just provide me with the meta tag from Google and I'll add it to your website immediately.

The tag will look something like this:
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE" />
```
